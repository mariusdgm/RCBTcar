# BT(BlueTooth) Car 

An old RC car whose remote was lost is modified by replacing the original receive + controller IC with an Arduino nano + bluetooth module combo.

This repository contrains code to control the toy car through Bluetooth from the computer using the keyboard or a racing wheel joystick, or using the smartphone.
